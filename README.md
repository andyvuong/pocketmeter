We have and we think there's a better way. Imagine being pushed a notification straight from your mobile phone that the time on your meter is running out. Now imagine directly paying for that meter for more time from your phone! No need to walk away from that hot date, dinner party, or other lovely outings to pay that bothersome meter!
