#What
pocketmeter offers a new way for paying for your car's street parking meter. Have you ever had to abruptly break from your plans just to pay a parking meter that's running out of time? We have and we think there's a better way. Imagine being pushed a notification straight from your mobile phone that the time on your meter is running out. Now imagine directly paying for that meter for more time from your phone! No need to walk away from that hot date, dinner party, or other lovely outings to pay that bothersome meter!

##The Solution
( secret for now :) )


##A Changing World
pocketmeter is our proof of concept of a new system we believe could change the way civilization handles paid parking. Always push for change. Keep Hacking!
